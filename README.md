# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

A comprehensive collection of interactive GUI applications solving classical DSA problems.

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements solutions for four key Data Structures and Algorithms problems using Python and Tkinter. Each problem is solved with a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes the algorithm in action.

## 📦 Included Problems

### 1. Tower of Hanoi
- **Algorithm**: Recursion
- **Features**: Animated disk movements, adjustable speed, move counter, and step-by-step sequence generation.
- **File**: `tower_of_hanoi.py`

### 2. Tree Traversals
- **Algorithm**: Binary Tree Traversals (DFS & BFS)
- **Features**: Visual binary tree, animated traversals (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order, Level-order), and node highlighting.
- **File**: `tree_traversals.py`

### 3. Huffman Coding
- **Algorithm**: Greedy Algorithm
- **Features**: Step-by-step Huffman tree construction, custom frequency input, and real-time encoding table generation.
- **File**: `huffman_coding.py`

### 4. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Algorithm**: Shortest Path (Graph)
- **Features**: Interactive graph visualization, animated path finding, and dynamic distance table updates.
- **File**: `dijkstra_algorithm.py`

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Python 3.x installed (Tkinter is included with standard Python).
2. **Run the Launcher**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will open the main dashboard where you can launch any of the four solutions.

3. **Run Individual Solutions**:
   You can also run each file independently:
   ```bash
   python tower_of_hanoi.py
   python tree_traversals.py
   python huffman_coding.py
   python dijkstra_algorithm.py
   ```
